Problem statement:
🔍 Situation:
AtliQ hardware is a company which delivers computer hardware & peripheral Manufacturers to his clients, which has several branches throughout India. The company is facing a lot of issues in terms of understanding how the business is performing and what are all the problem company is facing currently as the sales are not as expected and declining gradually.
Scaling within a dynamically changing market and lacking actionable insights, our organization needed a robust solution to stay ahead of the competition.

📈 Task:
I was tasked with performing data analysis using SQL and Power BI to track revenue growth, year-over-year (YOY) trends, and region-wise sales performance.

🚀 Action & Skills Learned:

To achieve this, I:

-Employed SQL queries to retrieve the necessary data and conducted high-level analysis.
-Connected the SQL database to Power BI, performed data cleaning, and executed ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) processes.
-Learned and applied DAX language for creating measures in Power BI.
-Developed an interactive Power BI dashboard with diverse visuals to display key metrics.


💡 Result:
The dashboard enabled quick, data-informed decisions, effectively displaying sales trends. This actionable insight allowed stakeholders to optimize products, prioritize customers, and evaluate sales performance, potentially raising revenue by at least 7% in the next quarter.
